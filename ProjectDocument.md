# Mage Race #

## Summary ##

**Mage Race is a 2d puzzle-platformer where players embark on a quest as a wizard to restore balance to the magical realm of Valenor. After dark mages stole relics and created evil spells, your role is to battle through treacherous levels spanning forests, ice caverns, and volcanic landscapes to defeat enemies and reclaim artifacts. Master your attacks while navigating through this challenging terrain to become the mage that saves Valenor!**

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**Controls:**
**Movement:**
* A - Move Left
* D - Move Right
* Space/W - Jump (Hold for increased height, let go for fast-fall)
* Left Shift/Right Shift - Dash (Can be used twice, has a cooldown of 1 second)

**Combat:**
* Left Click/F - Attack (Facing default direction)
* J - Attack Left
* L - Attack Right

**Menu:**
* Esc - Pause Menu

**How to Play**
**Launch the game to see the main menu, then press "Start". Choose between Forest, Ice, and the Lava levels. Each level can be replayed at any time, and the player can switch to a different level by navigating to the pause menu.**

**Health**
**You have 5 hearts everytime you start a level or respawn, which is displayed in the top-left corner. Taking damage from killzones, jumping off the map, or enemy attacks will either remove some or all of your hearts, so be mindful! If you die, you will automatically respawn at the start of the level after a 2-second death animation, with your hearts replenished.**

**Combat**
**Use your attacks to fight enemies from a safe distance, or dare to out-run them! Different enemies have different attack styles - experiment their movement and fighting logic to devise the most effective strategy.**

**Movement Tips**
**As for level navigation, remember to use the dash ability to cover long distances or escape danger. Holding horizontal and vertical movement (W/Space with A/D), as well as timing your dash(es) at the apex of your jump is recommended to cover the most amount of ground. Remember to disable the sticky keys shortcut (5x shift), if you have it enabled.**

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

For each team member, you should include work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
